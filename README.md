## Trip Planner App - Design Document

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the design for a trip planner app built using DynamoDB. The primary use case involves efficiently querying all trips for a specific user.

**2. System Requirements**

* **Data Model:** The app will store information about planned trips, including user ID, trip details (name, destination, dates), and optional details like activities, accommodations, and transportation.
* **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to accommodate a growing user base and increasing trip data.
* **Performance:** The app should efficiently retrieve all trips for a specific user.

**3. Proposed Solution**

**3.1 Data Model**

We will utilize DynamoDB as a NoSQL database for storing trip data. Here's the proposed schema:

* **Table Name:** Trips
* **Primary Key:**
    * `userId` (String): Unique identifier for the user who planned the trip.
    * `tripId` (String): Unique identifier for the specific trip within a user's data. (Composite primary key)
* **Secondary Indexes:**
    * **Global Secondary Index (GSI) on userId:** This index will allow efficient querying of all trips for a specific user.
* **Additional Attributes:**
    * `name` (String): The name of the trip.
    * `destination` (String): The location the trip is for.
    * `startDate` (Date): The start date of the trip.
    * `endDate` (Date): The end date of the trip.
    * `activities` (List): A list of planned activities for the trip. (Optional)
    * `accommodations` (List): A list of planned accommodations for the trip. (Optional)
    * `transportation` (List): A list of planned transportation details. (Optional)
    * `notes` (String):  A text field for additional notes about the trip. (Optional)


**3.2 GSI on userId**

A GSI will be created on the `userId` attribute of the primary key. This allows us to efficiently retrieve all trips for a specific user by querying the GSI with the user's ID.

**4. Benefits**

* **Efficient User Trip Queries:**  The GSI on `userId` enables fast retrieval of all trips for a specific user.
* **Scalability:** DynamoDB scales automatically to accommodate increasing data volume.
* **Flexibility:** The schema allows users to add details about activities, accommodations, and transportation as needed.

**5. Trade-offs**

* **Complexity:** Using a composite primary key and GSI adds some complexity compared to a single-attribute primary key.

**6. Implementation Details**

* The application code will interact with DynamoDB using the AWS SDK.
* Libraries can be used to simplify working with the data model within the application code.
* Provisioned Throughput capacity for the table and GSI will be adjusted based on expected read/write operations.

**7. Future Considerations**

* Additional indexes can be added to the table if new frequent query patterns emerge.
* Geolocation features can be integrated for location-based trip planning.

**8. Conclusion**

This design document proposes a scalable and efficient solution for the trip planner app using DynamoDB with a composite primary key and a GSI on `userId`. This approach optimizes performance for the primary use case of querying all trips for a specific user.
